              We use models and rates that reflect our willingness to create the right circumstances to deliver value for the right reasons, crafted to support the best people to get the job done.
            </p>
            <p>
              We identify primary drivers for an outcome as a relationship between delivery results, time and cost, employing engagement models that minimise the cost of risk by reducing the need to take risk at all. We look to the lessons found in lean and agile that deliver outcomes whilst reducing complexity.

            <p>
              We provide events, meetups and free classes in programming and digital disciplines for the public to practice skills, engage peer-to-peer, and to share insights. We host and sponsor community groups and external teams who wish to do the same.
            </p>
            <p>
              We hope for this to aid a greater understanding of digital and technical disciplines, and ultimately create valuable connections and friendships between community individuals, our company, our peers and our clients.

            <p>
              We are devoted to the research and implementation of sustainable development practices that keep pace, are reliable, and stay consistently productive. This includes maintaining constant attention to technical excellence, and is best achieved through policies that fund professional and educational opportunities for our staff.
            </p>
            <p>
              We keep a habit of daily connection and in-person communication in an effort to impart trust and empowerment to motivated people and self-organised teams. We strive to do the right work for the right reasons, and to develop, design and deliver systems that are simple and agile.
            </p>
            <p>
              We recognise the difference between valuing process and valuing people. Our mandate is to tune and adjust frequently and we meet regularly to discuss how to drive a better process in a better workplace. We respect the boundaries between work, family and personal time, and our flexible hours reflect this. Our parental leave scheme offers sustained support to our staff, whether they are primary or secondary carers.
